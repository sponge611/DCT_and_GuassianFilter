This homework includes these Matlab scripts code. They are just simple Matlab scripts, so for executing the program, 
just open them with Matlab and click "Run".

For question a, there are 6 Matlab scripts. They are:

DCT_22 

DCT_44

DCT_88

YIQ_DCT_22

YIQ_DCT_44

YIQ_DCT_88

The numbers in the filenames mean the size of DCT coefficients.

YIQ means the codes transform the loaded image into YIQ, then do the DCT and DCT inverse, and finally transform the result into RGB.

#You need to put the picture "cat1.png" into the same folder where the Matlab scripts are placed for running the codes.



For question b, there are 3 Matlab scripts. They are:

noise_dithering

average_dithering

error_diffusion_dithering

#You need to put the picture "cat2_gray.png" into the same folder where the Matlab scripts are placed for running the codes.



For question c, there are 5 Matlab scripts. They are:

Convolution_sigma1_33

Convolution_sigma1_55

Convolution_sigma1_77

Convolution_sigma5_55

Convolution_sigma10_55

#You need to put the picture "cat3_LR.png" into the same folder where the Matlab scripts are placed for running the codes.
